# Day 3
Write a program to determine if a person is eligible for voting or not.

Note: Voting age is 18.
User enters date of birth in a prompt in the format: dd/mm/yyy

===
Validation check: if the user is to be 18 years of age by tomorrow, it simply means the person cannot vote today...

Meaning you are calculating the person's age down to the day.
